KAYPRO 4

What year was it made? 
- 1984. Hence the nickname Kaypro 4 '84. 

What operating system does it run? 
- CP/M + an appication bundle which included Wordstar, dBase II, MicroPlan, Microsoft Basic, S-Basic, SuperCalc, and C-Basic. 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
- $1800 (plus an additional $700 for the printer). According to an inflation rate of 129%, a $1800 Kaypro in 1984 would cost $4,122.24 in current USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
- Not terribly difficult or expensive: I found a listing on ebay for for the computer and printer at the cost of $299.00

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
- The KAYPRO series in the early 1980s were known for being "rugged," portable (26 pounds) and coming with a software bundle 
that was much more impressive than other personal computers on the market. It had, at the time, in contrast to earlier models, 
impressive graphic capacity. It had a built in monitor with a shrp display.  The brightness, although only having two levels, 
could be adjusted, but this was (I think) available in earlier models.  It inaugarated the blinking square prompt.   
Unlike the Kapro II, the IV and 4 used double-sided disk drives.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
- I didn't have a problem turning it on.  Once I did, it was helpful that the monitor asked me to insert a disc (although it took me a ridcilous amount of time to realize that there is a Wordstar disc). 
Once I had the disc inserted, I was confronted with the ominous "AO>" Apart from unsuccessfully trying a series of "commands," which brought me nothing but regurgitations of my command with a question mark, or just question marks, I was making no progress.  I tried to find a Kaypro manual online.  I know that a few others has success doing so.  I, however, did not.  What I *did* find, was a youtube video wherein the person was just showing off his Kaypro.  I enlarged the screen and watched what he was typing.  That's when I discovered

APPLE IIe

What year was it made? 
    1983.

What operating system does it run? 
   Apple DOS 3.3, ProDOS

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
   In 1983, it cost $1400.  According to an inflation rate of 138.9%, it would cost $3,344.61 in current US funds. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
   One of the most interesting features of the Apple IIe was its keyboard. Certain models came with a numeric keypad, 
   and keyboards came with variations depending on the geographic region of its consumers. The apple series had an impressive 
   memory size (up to 48K of RAM) as well as came with innovative programs such as VisiCalc (spreadsheet) at reasonable prices. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. 
(If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
   This was a gratifying experience after the Kaypro.  Although the Kaypro looks super cool, the drastic degree of foreignness was
   extremely frustrating. It was interesting to see a tutorial that was not as interactive as more contemporary versions.  
   There's a different level of drugery to it.  And half the time I was struggling through the basic functions to get myself 
   through the tutorial.  
   Haha.  Hilarious.  The sound is fun, but definitely makes me much more appreciative of the speakers on my laptop!!!

MACINTOSH SE

What year was it made? 
- 1987. 

What operating system does it run?
- System 3.0, Finder 5.1? 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
- $2,898 (or $3,700 with a 20 MB hard drive). This is equivalent to $6,260.72 according to a 109.5% inflation ($7749.97). 

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 

   I found this model for prices ranging between $30 and $95 on ebay. 
   The cost depends on included accessories, such as speakers, keyboard, and drive capacity. 
   I would very much like to see one of the rare prototypes of the SE that were produced with transparent cases.   

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
   It was the first low-end, compact Mac with an expansion slot. It had an internal drive bay for a hard disk, but was also able to accomodate a floppy.  
   That being said, it's considerable storage capicity made external drives less important than it predecessors.
   It was one of the first Macs to include an Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), which permitted 16 input devices. It also came with the
   "Apple IIGS" --graphics and sound-- which enhanced multimedia capabilities.  According to Wikipedia, 
   it had "state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis."  Super exciting, in my opinion.  
   Those are the priorities, in my opinion!

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. 
What else is on this Mac?
   I found this easy to turn on and operate. I suspect that this was the computer I used at my elementary school, because 
   it seems strangely familiar to me.  That being said, the exhorbitant price tag makes me doubtful.  
   I didn't find it, but apparently there is an "Easter Egg" --4 pics of the engineering team--

VECTREX

What year was it made? 
   1982

What operating system does it run? 
   All I can find is its CPU: Motorloa 68A09.  I know this isn't correct.  Sigh. 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
   $199. This is equivalent to $490.68 according to 146.6% inflation rate. 

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
   The Vetrex seems plentiful on the secondhand market.  That being said, it costs the same, 
   if not more than it did in 1987 (not including, of course, inflation).  
   It ranges from $170 to $600 +. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
   It had an vector monitor, which displayed vector graphics, one of the popular displays used by arcade games.  
   This achieved color and graphics. It did not need to be connected to a television. It was the first and only home-based system to use a vector-based screen. 
   It also was the first home system with a 3D peripheral. It offered competative sound, with a range of effects.   

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. 
Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
   NOTE TO SELF: GO BACK AND USE.

AMIGA

What year was it made? 
- 1985 

What operating system does it run? 
   AmigaOS on Kickstart

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
   $1295 plus $300 for the monitor.  $2,863.74 121.1% $663.42 for the monitor.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
    It appears to be much easier to buy Amiga parts and accessories than it is to buy an actual Amiga.  
    Though I did find one for $500 on ebay. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
   The Amiga offered the best graphics and sound capabilities at its cost point. It allowed for multitasking--switching from one 
   task to another as the user pleased. It had a wide range of games and creative software.  It didn't fare well, however, due to poor marketing and a failure to keep up with competitors. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
   The Amiga makes some scary noises.  And it's use of disks is all very intimidating.  
   The little hand icon is really strange.  I did the dot demo from Workbench. 
   The mouse is super clunky and fun to use.  I never did figure out how to highlight anything from the menu.  
   I stared at the instructions while trying to do so.

MACINTOSH IIci

What year was it made? 
   1989

What operating system does it run?
   System 6.0.4, System 7.1.1 (Pro), System 7.5, Mac OS 7.6.1

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
   $6269.  91.9% inflation rate, makes it a whopping $12,029.65 in today's USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
   It's not too difficult to find the computer, but it seems that the monitor is a little more difficult to come by.  
   I found the combo on ebay from a starting range of $150 - $370. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? 
Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? 
What can you learn about its past user(s)?

   I actually kinda prefer the WordPerfect tool bar.  You can expand or diminish different elements by just clicking a little box for font etc.  
    For some reason, when I reset with the front left botton, there's color.  I have no idea what this is about. 
   The previous user was trying to print something, but since the printer isn't plugged in, I cancelled the print job. I can also tell that the 
   previous user had a disc in.
