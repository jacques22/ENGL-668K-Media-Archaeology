KAYPRO 4 [completed]

What year was it made? 
     
     1984. Hence the nickname Kaypro 4 '84. 

What operating system does it run? 
     
     CP/M + an appication bundle which included Wordstar, dBase II, MicroPlan, 
     Microsoft Basic, S-Basic, SuperCalc, and C-Basic. 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     The Kaypro 4 went for $1800 (plus an additional $700 for the printer). According to an inflation rate of 
     129%, a $1800 Kaypro in 1984 would cost $4,122.24 in current USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     Finding one of these is not terribly difficult or expensive: 
     I found a listing on ebay for the computer and printer at the cost of $299.00

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     The KAYPRO series in the early 1980s were known for being "rugged," portable (26 pounds) and for coming with 
     an impressive software bundle compared to other personal computers on the market. It also had, at the time, 
     in contrast to earlier models, impressive graphic capacity. It had a built in monitor with a sharp display.  
     The brightness, although only having two levels, could be adjusted, but this was (I think) available in earlier models.  
     It inaugarated the blinking square prompt (which the movie "Ghost" is indebted to).   
     Unlike the Kapro II, the IV and 4 used double-sided disk drives.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, 
experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
     
     I didn't have a problem turning it on. Actually, I was amazed at how quickly it was just ready to go.  
     There was none of the wait time that the computers of my young-adult years required. After learning more about the
     Amiga, my guess is that this is the difference between having an operating system with embedded software and relying
     almost entirely on external discs. The Kaypro's version of the Amiga's multi-tasking--according to the way I was fumbling 
     around with the Kaypro--is turning it off, ejecting a disc, turning it back on, and inserting a different disc. 
     Once a disc is inserted, it seems that this machine is loyal to no other, and must have its. I did realize that 
     I could command a disc drive switch, but I really didn't want to mess with that (truth be told, I tried once and failed).
     Because I was still expecting software to actually be embedded in the computer, it took me a ridcilous amount of time 
     to realize that to use Wordstar, I had to insert the right disc (blush). Once I inserted the correct disc, 
     I was confronted with the ominous "AO>". Apart from unsuccessfully trying a series of "commands," which brought me 
     nothing but regurgitations of my command with a question mark, or just question marks, I was making no progress.  
     I tried to find a Kaypro manual online.  I know that a few others had success doing so. I, however, could not find one.  
     What I *did* find, was a youtube video wherein the person was just showing off his Kaypro.  I enlarged the screen and 
     watched what he was typing.  That's when I discovered "dir."  The holy grail (I think?...well, it felt
     like the holy grail). And then so much information flooded the screen that I had a small heart attack. This couldn't 
     possibly have been considered a computer for common folks.  You have to know *exactly* what's up to get 
     anywhere.  There is no 'dinking' around to see what happens.  Such play leads to misery and question marks. 
     
     This user experience was horrible.  I would really really really like to see a live demonstration of the Kaypro because
     I really want to like it.

APPLE IIe [completed]

What year was it made? 
    
    1983.

What operating system does it run? 
   
   Apple DOS 3.3, ProDOS

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
   
   In 1983, it cost $1400.  
   According to an inflation rate of 138.9%, it would cost $3,344.61 in current US funds. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
   
   One interesting feature (at least to me) of the Apple IIe was its keyboard. Certain models came with a numeric keypad, 
   and keyboards came with variations depending on the geographic region of its consumers. The apple series had an impressive 
   memory size (up to 48K of RAM) and came with innovative programs such as VisiCalc (a spreadsheet program) at reasonable prices.
   These specs were HUGE for commercial computer use.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. 
(If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
   
   This was a gratifying experience after the Kaypro.  Although the Kaypro looks super cool, the drastic degree of foreignness was
   extremely frustrating. It was interesting to see a tutorial (on the Apple) that was less interactive than current tutorials. 
   Actually, I was happy to do without cheezy promo videos and unnecessarily enthusiastic playful interupptions. But,   
   there's a different level of drugery to it. You have to be committed. Half the time I was struggling my way through basic functions 
   required to get myself through the tutorial: I needed a tutorial for the tutorial.      
   
   The sound is fun, but it definitely helps me feel more appreciative of the speakers on my laptop!!! I 
   will think twice before complaining about the lack of bass. My engagement of Sea Dragon was brief and 
   uninspired.  It was tarnished by being worn out by the Kaypro.  I hope to return to it with a fresh regard
   (and with something obstructing my view of the Kaypro).

MACINTOSH SE [completed]

What year was it made? 
     
     1987. 

What operating system does it run?
     
     System 3.0, Finder 5.1.  

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
      The cost of this lovely machine was $2,898 (or $3,700 with a 20 MB hard drive). 
      This is equivalent to $6,260.72 according to a 109.5% inflation ($7749.97). !!!!  Whoa.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
    
     I found this model for prices ranging between $30 and $95 on ebay. 
     The cost depends on included accessories, such as speakers, keyboard, and drive capacity. 
     I would very much like to see one of the rare prototypes of the SE that were produced with transparent cases!!!
     Word on the street is that these are super expensive.  Who's got one?! 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     It was the first low-end, compact Mac with an expansion slot.  It had an internal drive 
     bay for a hard disk, but was also able to accomodate a floppy (I remember loving this feature at my elementary school 
     because while all of my classmates were using brand new discs, my parents gave me a box of floppy discs they picked up 
     from a thrift store. This slot allowed me to slyly use the floppies). That being said, it's considerable storage capicity 
     made external drives less important than it predecessors. It was also one of the first Macs to include an Apple Desktop 
     Bus (ADB), which permitted 16 input devices. It also came with the "Apple IIGS" --graphics and sound-- which enhanced 
     multimedia capabilities.  According to Wikipedia, it had "state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis."  
     Super exciting, in my opinion. These are absolute priorities, in my opinion! (Which, I know, completely contradicts
     my minimalist leanings when it comes to gaming).  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. 
What else is on this Mac?
     
     I found this easy to turn on and operate. Although it took me a while to realize it, this was the first 
     computer I ever used. I can barely recall it, but there was a strangely familiarity.  
     That being said, the exhorbitant price tag makes me doubtful myself.  Mind you,I was using it a few years after 
     it was released...so, there's that.  
     
     What I find most impressive about this computer, is that it both reduces your need for "external plastic" (my own term), 
     and caters to your desires to see the computer as a conduit to other devices (and forms of media). 
     One of the benefits of having a personal computer is not having to carry around external storage devices 
     (though, of course, smart people back everything up...but now we can throw it to the clouds!! Brilliant language use) . 
     
     As far as what else is on this Mac, I didn't find it, but apparently there is an "Easter Egg" --4 pics of the engineering team-- 
     hidden somewhere on these models.  Right? Figuring out how to find such a thing is far beyond me 
     (I didn't even know what was meant by an "Easter Egg" until I googled it).

VECTREX [completed] 

(note: I have a friend with one of these, and he let me borrow it.  I hope that's okay.  It was easier to have access to
it at home.  Although the kids were very upset when I returned it!).

What year was it made? 
     
     1982

What operating system does it run? 
     
     I had some difficulty figuring this out.  At first all I could find was its CPU: Motorloa 68A09.  
     Now, I'm wondering if it's more simple than I realized.  Is it just the Vectrex OS?   

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
     It went for $199. This is equivalent to $490.68 according to 146.6% inflation rate. 
     Seems like a steel for a serious designer or gamer.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     The Vetrex seems plentiful on the secondhand market.  That being said, it costs the same, 
     if not more than it did in 1987 (not including, of course, inflation).  
     The expense ranges from $170 to $600 +.  That's a huge range. 
     I can't make enough sense of the jargon to determine why one would sell for so much more than another. 
     I'm assuming this is determined by modern upgrades? 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     The Vectrex has a vector monitor, which could display vector graphics. In its day, this type of display was used for
     the most popular arcade games. It achieved graphics without the necessity of connecting to a television. 
     It was also the first and only home-based system to use the vector-based screen and the first home system 
     with a 3D peripheral. It offered sound with a range of effects, which apparantely knocked the competition 
     out of the park (at least for home-based systems). Although the color capacity was limited, there are plastic screen
     overlays for color-enhancement.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. 

     The graphics, compared to what's currently on the market, aren't dazzling, but I love them.  
     I find the minimalism appealing.  Plodding back in time before the (to be really dramatic) *surging accessiveness
     in graphics complexity* available cureently (depth, color spectrum, detail and ranges of motion...the same applies to 
     sound), is really refreshing. It simplifies the real objectives: get out of the way, get in the line of fire, shoot 
     that way (FAST), and so on. Also, the game is *not* 'reality.' I don't play it to be 'real.'  
     So, why would I want to engage in a replication-attempt of it? There is also less distraction on the screen. By this I mean, game-status information, not graphics.
     That being said, the information it does offer, to my eyes, seems cryptic. 
     
     I now recall the "joy" of the joystick! The simplicity of the game device (is that what it's called?) is delightful. 
     Although, it makes me feel like a bit of a monkey.  It seems to deem nuanced dexterity unnecessary (but that being said…
     I STILL SUCK AT IT).  When I get 'hit'… although there is an impact sound, I found myself expecting a rumble pack to engage.  
     At first, the absence made play feel anti-climactic, but then again, it was also a lot less distressing or sensorily 
     overwhelming. There is an appeal and satisfaction to the size of the cartridge. As in, clunk clunk, I have officially inserted 
     this cartridge and I’m going to play now. I'm already in action.  
     
     P.S: Can I just say that the “Minestorm” logo is AMAZING. They just don’t make them like that anymore.  
     It would be a great sparkly deco for a t-shirt.  
   
   Why do you think the designers would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
     
     Well, I had to dig around a bit, but I read that vetor graphics, as opposed to pixel-based graphics,  
     can be magnified without detracting from the quality. This makes the game design translatable 
     between arcade screens, home-based system, and the eventual hand-held device.  This is the same for all design production. For example, large-scale art prints. 
     A design could be blown up and look exactly the same. 
     
     Game designers weren’t dealing with image files (right?), 'just' graphics.  So the pixel-based graphics were
     unnecessary.  I also suppose that because game design objectives are trajectory-based, precision in lines of 
     motion were of the utmost importance.  I know absolutely nothing about designing a game, but it seems that determining 
     lines of movement and impact of objects (being shot out of other shapes at yet another shape), requires a more 
     mathematical approach.  
     
     One last thing: that the “vectrex buzz” is a term, is fascinating to me.  In fact, I have found the sounds of nearly all 
     the machines assigned to be noteworthy.  Currently, if a desktop or laptop computer (apart from notification sounds) is audible while merely
     running, it has issues, such as an overheating fan, or a confused drive.  You never want to be that person in class with the laptop 
     that sounds like an aircraft. It’s disruptive and embarrassing.  
     What impact did the “white noise” of personal computers have on the users?  Are we missing something now?  
     Is this a good thing? Bad thing? Just a thing?

AMIGA [completed]

What year was it made? 
     
     1985 

What operating system does it run? 
     
     AmigaOS on Kickstart (I don't really understand what the "Kickstart" is about). 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
     This computer went for $1295, plus $300 for the monitor.  At a 121.1% inflation rate, this is equivalent to
     $2,863.74 for the computer and $663.42 for the monitor.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     It appears to be much easier to buy Amiga parts and accessories than it is to buy an actual Amiga.  
     Though I did find one for $500 on ebay. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     The Amiga was all about the chips. It offered the best graphics and sound capabilities at its cost point. 
     It also allowed for multitasking--switching between tasks while running them simultaneously. This was a major innovation. 
     It offered a wide range of games and creative software and because the operating system was embedded in a ROM chip, 
     the computer could boot without the need for a separate disk. The Amiga also initiated video/audio file capacity. This
     was huge for mixing music and creating videos. 
     It didn't fare well, apparently, due to poor marketing and a failure to keep up with competitors. 
     But owners LOVE their Amigas. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). 
Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
     
     The Amiga makes some scary noises.  And it's use of disks is all very intimidating. I thought there would be more
     embedded software.  The little hand icon is really strange, but the mouse is super clunky and fun to use (I miss bottons). 
     I couldn't figure out how to highlight anything from the menus, despite what the instruction manual said. 
     FINALLY, I found an on-line blog that explained it as follows: opposed to the Mac, which requires you to left click, 
     you have to *release* the botton.  Gracious. I am so trained to select things in specific ways that I 
     literally couldn't think beyond it without being explained by way of comparison to what I am familar with. 
     
     There seem to to be a lot more symbols on the Amiga keypad than I'm accustomed to.  But, there also seems to 
     be something missing too.  I can’t say for sure, because I am a minimalist keyboard user:
     I know barely any of the shortcuts. This is something I really need to remedy. 
     
      What else can it do?!: Because the Amiga supports video/audio, it can be used to create electronic music, mix music
      (I think?) and create videos. But, I can't imagine myself not having given up on this.  Compared to the versatility 
      and interface of current software, this would be incredibly frustrating.  The graphics are so limited, and the 
      elements on-screen are so fixed.  It makes me realize how much less inhibiting the ability to drag things around 
      fluidily (such as with most current Mac and PC music/video software) is to the creative process.  It's jarring. 
      
      On a side-note, I find the story behind the name of this machine quite interesting in displeasing way. 
      Amiga, is "girlfriend" in Spanish. All of the chips were given female names. 
      For example, the sound chip was named "Paula" by the development team.  
      
      And on a really side-side-note, after playing around with it and learning of its name history and
      about its use for music/video...I suspect there was a lot of cocaine snorted in and around these machines.

MACINTOSH IIci [completed]

What year was it made? 
     
     1989

What operating system does it run?
     
     I found the following list: System 6.0.4, System 7.1.1 (Pro), System 7.5, Mac OS 7.6.1.
     I couldn't determine which version the 1989 model used, but I'm assuming it was 6.0.4.

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
     It was $6269.  With a 91.9% inflation rate, this computer was a whopping $12,029.65 in current USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     It's not too difficult to find the computer, but the monitor seems more difficult to come by.  
     I found the combo on ebay for a startingly broad range of $150 - $370. Why such a price variety? 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

     After digging around, it seems that this Macintosh is very similar to other models.  As a result, it wasn't really 
     a stand out in enough ways to fill a paragraph (I'm probably very wrong about this). Yet, it had one pretty 
     weighty new trick: it was the first (or one of the first) super "expandible" Macintoshes. There were numerous 
     parts, add-ons and upgrades available, which accomodated a broad-range of users.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? 
Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? 
What can you learn about its past user(s)?

     I actually kinda prefer the WordPerfect tool bar to the MS Word on the IIci.  You can expand or diminish different elements 
     by just clicking a little box. These de-cluttered the screen a wee bit. But honestly, I can't imagine word processing on this.
     I felt that, unlike more current Word programs, I couldn't really get a sense of my visual page.  That's one massive difference 
     I have noticed here.  On my PC or Macbook, I can change the "view," which gives me different angles of the document.  
     Now that I've noticed this, however, I'm not exaclty certain why having these different angles (manuscript, webpage, etc) seem so helpful to me with regards to the mass (?) or variation of my paragraphs
     or the spacing of my pages.  In both programs of the IIci, my view is so close and limited.  The tool bars on the periphery (especially
     in MS Word) almost overpower the text I am trying to focus on.  
     
     The previous user was trying to print something, but since the printer isn't plugged in (is it?) I cancelled the print job. 
     I can also tell that the previous user had a disc in...because he/she left it there...and I couldn't figure out how to eject it.  
     I tried everything just short of the "last resort" - getting a paperclip and forcing it out.  Yes, I was evil.  I ran out of time
     and dashed away (like the person before me) and left the next person to try and figure it out.  I have a feeling I will get a bad grade.  
     Karma.  
     
     One unsolved mystery:  when I "reset" (I think?) with the front left "botton" on the monitor, the display converts from 
     black and white to color.  I have no idea what this is about. Is this an add-on?  Was I doing something wrong to begin with?  Or was
     I doing something wrong, which caused the color.
