KAYPRO 4

What year was it made? 
     1984. Hence the nickname Kaypro 4 '84. 

What operating system does it run? 
     CP/M + an appication bundle which included Wordstar, dBase II, MicroPlan, Microsoft Basic, S-Basic, SuperCalc, and C-Basic. 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     $1800 (plus an additional $700 for the printer). According to an inflation rate of 129%, a $1800 Kaypro in 1984 would cost $4,122.24 in current USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     Finding one of these is not terribly difficult or expensive (at least today): 
     I found a listing on ebay for for the computer and printer at the cost of $299.00

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     The KAYPRO series in the early 1980s were known for being "rugged," portable (26 pounds) and coming with a software bundle 
     that was much more impressive than other personal computers on the market. It had, at the time, in contrast to earlier models, 
     impressive graphic capacity. It had a built in monitor with a shrp display.  The brightness, although only having two levels, 
     could be adjusted, but this was (I think) available in earlier models.  It inaugarated the blinking square prompt.   
     Unlike the Kapro II, the IV and 4 used double-sided disk drives.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, 
experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
     
     I didn't have a problem turning it on. Actually, I was amazed at how quickly it was just ready to go.  There was none of the 
     wait time necessary for loading images on the desktop (or whatever it is that takes my PC so long to warm up). 
     Once I did turn it on, it was helpful that the monitor asked me to insert a disc (although it took me a 
     ridcilous amount of time to realize that there is an actual Wordstar disc). It seemed that once I inserted a disc, the machine was
     loyal to it, and none other.  I had to turn it off, take it out, and start over.  I did realize that I could command a disc drive switch, 
     but I really didn't want to mess with that (truth be told, I tried and failed). Once I inserted the correct disc, I was confronted with the ominous "AO>" 
     Apart from unsuccessfully trying a series of "commands," which brought me nothing but regurgitations of my command with a question mark, 
     or just question marks, I was making no progress.  I tried to find a Kaypro manual online.  I know that a few others has success doing so.  
     I, however, did not.  What I *did* find, was a youtube video wherein the person was just showing off his Kaypro.  I enlarged the screen and 
     watched what he was typing.  That's when I discovered "dir."  The holy grail.  And then so much information flood the screen that I had a small heart attack.
     This couldn't possibly have been considered a computer for common folk.  You have to know *exactly* what's up to get 
     anywhere.  There is no dinking around to see what happens.  Such play leads to misery and question marks.

APPLE IIe

What year was it made? 
    
    1983.

What operating system does it run? 
   
   Apple DOS 3.3, ProDOS

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
   
   In 1983, it cost $1400.  
   According to an inflation rate of 138.9%, it would cost $3,344.61 in current US funds. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
   
   One of the most interesting features of the Apple IIe was its keyboard. Certain models came with a numeric keypad, 
   and keyboards came with variations depending on the geographic region of its consumers. The apple series had an impressive 
   memory size (up to 48K of RAM) and came with innovative programs such as VisiCalc (a spreadsheet program) at reasonable prices. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. 
(If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
   
   This was a gratifying experience after the Kaypro.  Although the Kaypro looks super cool, the drastic degree of foreignness was
   extremely frustrating. It was interesting to see a tutorial (on the Apple) that was not as interactive as more contemporary versions.  
   There's a different level of drugery to it.  You have to be committed. Half the time I was struggling my way through basic functions 
   to get myself through the tutorial, in ways that were more elementary than what the tutorial was addressing.    
   Haha.  Hilarious.  The sound is fun, but definitely makes me much more appreciative of the speakers on my laptop!!! I 
   will think twice before complaining. I think my experience of Sea Dragon was tarnished by being worn out by the Kaypro.  
   I hope to return to it with a fresh regard.

MACINTOSH SE

What year was it made? 
     
     1987. 

What operating system does it run?
     
     System 3.0, Finder 5.1.  

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
      The cost of this lovely machine was $2,898 (or $3,700 with a 20 MB hard drive). 
      This is equivalent to $6,260.72 according to a 109.5% inflation ($7749.97). !!!!  Whoa.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
    
     I found this model for prices ranging between $30 and $95 on ebay. 
     The cost depends on included accessories, such as speakers, keyboard, and drive capacity. 
     I would very much like to see one of the rare prototypes of the SE that were produced with transparent cases!!!
     Word on the street is that these are super expensive.  Who's got one?! 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     It was the first low-end, compact Mac with an expansion slot. It had an internal drive bay for a hard disk, 
     but was also able to accomodate a floppy.  That being said, it's considerable storage capicity made external drives less important than it predecessors.
     It was one of the first Macs to include an Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), which permitted 16 input devices. It also came with the
     "Apple IIGS" --graphics and sound-- which enhanced multimedia capabilities.  According to Wikipedia, 
     it had "state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis."  Super exciting, in my opinion.  
     These are absolute priorities, in my opinion!

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. 
What else is on this Mac?
     
     I found this easy to turn on and operate. I suspect that this was the computer I used at my elementary school, because 
     it seems strangely familiar to me.  That being said, the exhorbitant price tag makes me doubtful of this.  Mind you,
     I was using it a few years after it was released...so, there's that.  
     What I find most impressive about this computer, is that it both reduces your need for "external plastic" (my own term), 
     and caters to your desires to see it as a conduit to other devices (and forms of media). One of the benefits of having a 
     personal computer is not having to carry around external storage devices (though, of course, smart people back everything up...
     but now we can throw it to the clouds!! Brilliant language use) . 
     As far as what else is on this Mac, I didn't find it, but apparently there is an "Easter Egg" --4 pics of the engineering team-- 
     hidden somewhere on these models.  Right? Figuring out how to find such a thing is far beyond me (I didn't even know what an "Easter Egg" was before googling it).

VECTREX

What year was it made? 
     
     1982

What operating system does it run? 
     
     All I can find is its CPU: Motorloa 68A09.  I know this isn't correct.  Sigh. 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
     It went for $199. This is equivalent to $490.68 according to 146.6% inflation rate. 
     Seems like a steel for a series designer.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     The Vetrex seems plentiful on the secondhand market.  That being said, it costs the same, 
     if not more than it did in 1987 (not including, of course, inflation).  
     It ranges from $170 to $600 +.  That's a huge range. I can't make enough sense of the jargon to determine why.  

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     The Vectrex has a vector monitor, which could display vector graphics. In its day, this was display used by
     the most popular arcade games. It could achieve color and graphics without being connected to a television. 
     It was the first and only home-based system to use the vector-based screen. 
     It also was the first home system with a 3D peripheral. 
     It offered sound with a range of effects, which apparantely knocked the competition out of the park (at least for 
     home-based systems).  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. 
Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?

     The graphics, compared to what's currently on the market, don't seem impressive, but I like it.  
     I find the minimalism appealing.  Plodding backward before the (to be really dramatic) surging accessiveness
     in graphics (depth, color spectrum, complexity and fluidity of motion) resulting from technological development 
     is really refreshing.  Reminds you of what the real objective is.

AMIGA

What year was it made? 
     
     1985 

What operating system does it run? 
     
     AmigaOS on Kickstart (I don't really understand what the "Kickstart" is about). 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
     $1295 plus $300 for the monitor.  $2,863.74 121.1% $663.42 for the monitor.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     It appears to be much easier to buy Amiga parts and accessories than it is to buy an actual Amiga.  
     Though I did find one for $500 on ebay. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
     
     The Amiga offered the best graphics and sound capabilities at its cost point. It allowed for multitasking--switching from one 
     task to another as the user pleased. It had a wide range of games and creative software.  It didn't fare well, however, due to poor marketing and a failure to keep up with competitors. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). 
Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
     
     The Amiga makes some scary noises.  And it's use of disks is all very intimidating.  
     The little hand icon is really strange.  I did the dot demo from Workbench. 
     The mouse is super clunky and fun to use.  I never did figure out how to highlight anything from the menu, despite what 
     the instruction manual suggested I could.  I tried every kind of mouse-click variation.

MACINTOSH IIci

What year was it made? 
     
     1989

What operating system does it run?
     
     System 6.0.4, System 7.1.1 (Pro), System 7.5, Mac OS 7.6.1

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
     
     It was $6269.  91.9% inflation rate, makes it a whopping $12,029.65 in current USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
     
     It's not too difficult to find the computer, but it seems that the monitor is a little more difficult to come by.  
     I found the combo on ebay for a startingly broad range of $150 - $370. Why such a price variety? 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? 
Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? 
What can you learn about its past user(s)?

     I actually kinda prefer the WordPerfect tool bar.  You can expand or diminish different elements by just clicking a little box for font etc.
     I feel like it's hard to say until I could get more of a "print preview."  I felt that, unlike more current Word programs, I 
     couldn't really get a sense of my visual page.  That's one massive difference I have noticed here.  On my PC or Macbook, I can change
     the "view," which gives me different angles of the document.  Now that I've noticed this, however, I'm not exaclty certain 
     why having these different angles (manuscript, webpage, etc) seem so helpful to me with regards to the mass (?) or variation of my paragraphs
     or the spacing of my pages.  In both programs of the IIci, my view is so close and limited.  The tool bars on the periphery almost 
     overpower the text I am trying to focus on.  
     One ongoing mystery:  when I "reset" (I think?) with the front left "botton" on the monitor, the display converts from 
     black and white to color.  I have no idea what this is about. Is this an add-on?  Was I doing something wrong to begin with?  Or was
     I doing something wrong, which caused the color.  
     
     The previous user was trying to print something, but since the printer isn't plugged in (is it?) I cancelled the print job. 
     I can also tell that the previous user had a disc in...because he/she left it there...and I couldn't figure out how to eject it.  
     I tried everything just short of the "last resort" - getting a paperclip and forcing it out.  Yes, I was evil.  I ran out of time
     and dashed away (like the person before me) and left the next person to try and figure it out.  I have a feeling I will get a bad grade.  
     Karma.
