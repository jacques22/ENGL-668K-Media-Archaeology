Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

What year was it made? 
- 1984. Hence the nickname Kaypro 4 '84. 

What operating system does it run? 
- CP/M + an appication bundle which included Wordstar, dBase II, MicroPlan, Microsoft Basic, S-Basic, SuperCalc, and C-Basic. 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
- $1800 (plus an additional $700 for the printer). According to an inflation rate of 129%, a $1800 Kaypro in 1984 would cost $4,122.24 in current USD.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
- Not terribly difficult or expensive: I found a listing on ebay for for the computer and printer at the cost of $299.00

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
- The KAYPRO series in the early 1980s were known for being "rugged," portable (26 pounds) and coming with a software bundle that was much more impressive than other personal computers on the market. 
It had, at the time, in contrast to earlier models, impressive graphic capacity. It had a built in monitor with a shrp display.  The brightness, although only having two levels, could be adjusted, but this was (I think) available in earlier models.  It inaugarated the blinking square prompt.   
Unlike the Kapro II, the IV and 4 used double-sided disk drives.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

APPLE IIe

What year was it made? 
- 1983.

What operating system does it run? 
- Apple DOS 3.3, ProDOS

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
- In 1983, it cost $1400.  According to an inflation rate of 138.9%, it would cost $3,344.61 in current US funds. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
- One of the most interesting features of the Apple IIe was its keyboard. Certain models came with a numeric keypad, and keyboards came with variations depending on the geographic region of its consumers.  
The apple series had an impressive memory size (up to 48K of RAM) as well as came with innovative programs such as VisiCalc (spreadsheet) at reasonable prices. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

MACINTOSH SE

What year was it made? 
- 1987. 

What operating system does it run?
- System 3.0, Finder 5.1? 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
- $2,898 (or $3,700 with a 20 MB hard drive). This is equivalent to $6,260.72 according to a 109.5% inflation ($7749.97). 

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
- I found this model for prices ranging between $30 and $95 on ebay. The cost depends on included accessories, such as speakers, keyboard, and drive capacity. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
- It was the first low-end, compact Mac with an expansion slot. It had an internal drive bay for a hard disk, but was also able to accomodate a floppy.  That being said, it's considerable storage capicity made external drives less important than it predecessors.
It was one of the first Macs to include an Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), which permitted 16 input devices. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?

VECTREX

What year was it made? 
- 1982

What operating system does it run? 
- All I can find is its CPU: Motorloa 68A09 

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
$199. This is equivalent to $490.68 according to 146.6% inflation rate. 

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
- The Vetrex seems plentiful on the secondhand market.  That being said, it costs the same, if not more than it did in 1987 (not including, of course, inflation).  
It ranges from $170 to $600 +. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
- It had an vector monitor, which displayed vector graphics, one of the popular displays used by arcade games.  
This achieved color and graphics. It did not need to be connected to a television. It was the first and only home-based system to use a vector-based screen. 
It also was the first home system with a 3D peripheral. It offered competative sound, with a range of effects.   

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?

AMIGA

What year was it made? 
- 1985 

What operating system does it run? 
- AmigaOS on Kickstart

How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? 
$1295 plus $300 for the monitor.  

How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
- It appears to be much easier to buy Amiga parts and accessories than it is to buy an actual Amiga.  Though I did find one for $500 on ebay. 

In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
- The Amiga offered the best graphics and sound capabilities at its cost point. It allowed for multitasking--switching from one task to another as the user pleased. 
It had a wide range of games and creative software.  It didn't fare well, however, due to poor marketing and a failure to keep up with competitors. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
